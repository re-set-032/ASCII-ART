About :
ASCII Art is mainly focussed on producing images solely based on ASCII characters.
Here I will basically work on making ascii art from any RGB image based on grayscaling and later their pixel lightness values are mapped with ASCII characters to generate this art.

Content:
images => contains all images both RGB and greyscaled ones.
out => will contain output art.
src => contains all necessary code for generating art.
