About :
ASCII Art is mainly focussed on producing images solely based on ASCII characters.
Here I will basically work on making ascii art from any image after converting it to grayscale image and later their pixel intensity/lightness values are mapped with ASCII characters to generate this art.

Content:
1. images folder => contains other sample images to test out the code.
2. Art.py => The python code which will convert image to ascii image after processing
3. README.txt => This file basically
4. INSTRUCTIONS.txt => This file contains instructions about how to run the python code.
5. selfie.jpg => My selfie image (basically a test image which will be used for generating output) for this assignment purpose only.
				(No special reason for putting my dumb image here :) )

NOTE: READ INSTRUCTIONS.txt to know mpre about how to run the python code.
