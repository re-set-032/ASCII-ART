READ CAREFULLY 

INSTRUCTIONS to run the code : 

=>  First of all let me clear some things regarding the code.
=>  This code i.e Art.py supports certain flags which can be used to pass parameters to the code. One of them is mandatory 
    if you don't specify that the code will not run.
=>  This code has one mandatory flag for input image path

=> 	The supported flags are listed below :
	--input INPUT_IMAGE_PATH : use this to specify input image path (absolute/relative)  
	--out  OUTPUT_FILE_PATH  : use this to specify output file path (absolute/relative) (default = "out.txt" in current folder as the code itself)
	--tW   TILE_WIDTH 		 : use this to set tile width (default = 8)
	--tH   TILE_HEIGHT 		 : use this to set tile height (default = 10)
	--grey 			         : use this if the input image is already greyscaled (mandatory if input image is greyscaled 
                               otherwise no need of this flag) (default is set only for colored images)
	--use70					 : use this if you want to map pixels based on ascii_70_charset (see code for more details) 
                               (by default ascii_10_charset is used in mapping)
    --show                   : use this if you want to print the ascii image in terminal window 
                               (not suggested though since you have to resize font size of terminal to view the image clearly)
    
=> Examples instructions commands to run Art.py using terminal:-

	python3 Art.py --input selfie.jpg                         (assumming input image is colored) 
						or
	python3 Art.py --input selfie.jpg --out output.txt        (assumming input image is colored)
						or
	python3 Art.py --input selfie.jpg --out output.txt --grey (assumming input image is greyscaled)
