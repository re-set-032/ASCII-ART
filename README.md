# ASCII ART

Author: ronin117_prog

Release Version: 1.0 + 2.0

## About :
ASCII Art is mainly focussed on producing images solely based on ASCII characters.
Here I will basically work on making ascii art from any RGB image based on grayscaling and later their pixel lightness values are mapped with ASCII characters to generate this art.

## Content:

> 1. images => contains all images both RGB and greyscaled ones.
> 2. out => will contain output art.
> 3. src => contains all necessary code for generating art.
